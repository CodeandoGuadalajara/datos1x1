### The Homepage ###

Lookbook works like any normal WordPress theme. You simply create posts and assign a featured image for each post. Thus, each image on the homepage is actually a post with a featured image assigned to it.

### The Lookbook ###

Lookbook allows your viewers to select their favorite photographs and download them as a lookbook pdf. This gives editors and potential clients and easy, centralized way to save their favorite photos seen on your website. Additionally, Lookbook allows you to optionally require that users provide an email address in order to download the PDF. This is a great way to help grow your email subscriber base.

The Lookbook feature can be enabled through the Theme Options &gt; Lookbook tab. This will also automatically create a Lookbook page for you. This page is a container where the images that users added gets collected. Once the Lookbook page is created you will see a Save link (with a folder icon) on top of the images (when you hover over the image). Click that icon to save the image to the Lookbook page and download the Lookbook pdf.

The folder icon on the top right shown on the demo is the menu for Lookbook page. It shows up automatically if you enable the Lookbook feature on Appearance -> Theme Options -> Lookbook. When your visitors click the Save icon on images to create their own Lookbook, the Lookbook menu count will increase. Clicking the Lookbook menu will take them to the Lookbook page where they can download their custom PDF.

And finally, each Lookbook that a user creates is saved in WordPress, which you can view on the Lookbook tab in wp-admin. This is useful when you want to track who creates Lookbooks and which images they saved.


### Sell Media integration (optional) ###

If you have activated Sell Media plugin (http://graphpaperpress.com/plugins/sell-media/), you will also see a cart menu on the top right. The Buy (cart icon) button only appears on the images that you upload via Sell Media menu in your wp-admin. This icon will lead to Sell Media Checkout page. Lookbook and Sell Media works independently and separately. Its obvious that you won't want to allow users to download the images that you want to sell. You can read more about Sell Media here (http://graphpaperpress.com/support/instructions/?plugin=sell-media).

### Creating Galleries ###
